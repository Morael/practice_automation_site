# practice_automation_site
Practice for automation testing in python using unittest

In these files I am creating a Page Object Model for website: http://practice.automationtesting.in/
For this project I am using test cases from : http://practice.automationtesting.in/test-cases/
At this moment I have created 10 tests based on POM model in the table Home Page.
After I finish all of Home Page test cases, my plan is to create other test cases using pytest module.
