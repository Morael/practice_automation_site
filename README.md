# practice_automation_site
Practice for automation testing in python using unittest

In these files I am creating a Page Object Model for website: 
http://practice.automationtesting.in/

For this project I am using test cases from : 
http://practice.automationtesting.in/test-cases/

At this moment I have created 10 tests based on POM model in the table Home Page.
After I finish all of Home Page test cases (18), my plan is to create other test cases using pytest module. 

POM model at this point:
[Practice automation]
=> _Pages
  -> shopPage_py
  -> homePage.py
  -> loginPage.py
  -> regPage.py
  -> accountPage.py
=> _Reports
  -> TestResults___main__.HomeTest_2020-10-19_11-05-19.html
=> _Tests
  -> tests.py
